# Telestion Application Template

This is a template for Telestion applications.
It helps you to set up the publishing of Telestion applications.
Dependencies to the [main repo](https://github.com/wuespace/telestion-core) are included, too.

## Necessary Changes

- [ ] `settings.gradle` - set `rootProject.name`
- [ ] `Dockerfile` - replace `TelestionTemplate` in the CMD block by the new project's name (they must match exactly!)
- [ ] `build.gradle` - replace `group` by your group name
  (it is recommended to follow [Maven Central `groupId` naming conventions](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-naming-conventions.html),
  i.e., beginning with the company url in reverse)
- [ ] `conf/config.json` - adapt to fit your needs
- [ ] `src/main/java` - add your source code
- [ ] install the Telestion Client PSC (see [`client/README.md`](client/README.md) for further information)
- [ ] update the README

## Example Project

A working example is provided in the [RocketSound repository](https://github.com/wuespace/telestion-rocketsound).
